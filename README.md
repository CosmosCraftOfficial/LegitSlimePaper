# LegitSlimePaper - An AdvancedSlimePaper fork with command related features needed for the Legitimoose server.

This is an example project, showcasing how to setup a fork of Paper (or any other fork using paperweight), using paperweight.

The files of most interest are
- build.gradle.kts
- settings.gradle.kts
- gradle.properties

When updating upstream, be sure to keep the dependencies noted in `build.gradle.kts` in sync with upstream.
It's also a good idea to use the same version of the Gradle wrapper as upstream.

# `Process finished with exit code 128`?
This error happens because the default Windows path limit is 255 characters. Change the following key in the [registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry) to fix it:
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled - Set to 1
```
Make sure to also change the path limit in git:
```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Branches

Each branch of this project represents an example:

 - [`main` is the standard example](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-examples/tree/main)
 - [`submodules` shows how paperweight can be applied on a fork using the more traditional git submodule system](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-examples/tree/submodules)
