# LegitSlimePaper - An AdvancedSlimePaper fork with command related features needed for the Legitimoose server.

This is an example project, showcasing how to setup a fork of Paper (or any other fork using paperweight), using paperweight.

The files of most interest are
- build.gradle.kts
- settings.gradle.kts
- gradle.properties

When updating upstream, be sure to keep the dependencies noted in `build.gradle.kts` in sync with upstream.
It's also a good idea to use the same version of the Gradle wrapper as upstream.

# `Process finished with exit code 128`?
This error occurs because the default Windows path limit is 255 characters. There cannot be paths longer than 255 characters, which is obviously bad, especially if you have many nested folders. Change the following key in the [Windows Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry) to fix it:
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled - Set to 1
```
Make sure to also allow long paths in git:
```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Branches

Each branch of this project represents an example:

 - [`main` is the standard example](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-examples/tree/main)
 - [`submodules` shows how paperweight can be applied on a fork using the more traditional git submodule system](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-examples/tree/submodules)
